# 2-D-Unsteady-Conduction-in-Plate

Aim: Two-Dimensional Unsteady Heat Conduction in Square Copper Plate.

Note:

-->Actually, I would have compared my Numerical results with Experimental heat conduction results. Unfortunately, I was not able to do that because we had Metal Rod in our Thermal Laboratory. But no worries, one can also do the same numerical implimentation on metal rod as well figure out the discretised equation and implement it in looping condition as mentioned in Result>Equations_Code_Result.pdf file.

Results:

-->I compared my Code with Korosh Agha Mohammad Ghasemi Chemical Engineering at Shiraz University. Though it was the comparison among Numerical Methods, I was confident enough to know my code is providing correct results. Also, my code is short compared to that of online MATLAB Code.

-->I used explicit method to discretise my “Two-Dimensional Heat Conduction equation without Heat Generation” so the results are showing lower accuracy. Instead of explicit method one can also use Central Difference Scheme or Implicit Method, etc.
